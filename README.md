# A game to learn how to read in German

This is a simple game that I have been developing to help me to learn how to read in German. Despite having a complex grammar, I believe the true challenge for learn German, on the perspective of a latin language native, is the Wortzschtaz (i.e., the vocabulary). That's why this game has an exclusiv focus on building vocabulary. More specifically, its purpose is present you all unknown words of a previously selected text that you want to read, then let you play with them until you have enough knowledge of the meaning of most new words. After playing the game, you will be ready to actually read the text.

[Here](https://github.com/lucascr91/german_game) you can find an early version of this game. I developed this version when I was in my very beginner as a Python programmer, I am still a beginner, but I guess I have learned a few tricks since that first attempt. The version 0.0.1 is just an interactive game which runs in terminal. It select all words, and go on asking the player if she/he already know that word. On negative answers for this question, the program presents the meaning of the word that it gets from the online dictionary [Collins](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/german-english/). After the game, the words whose meaning the player now has marked as known words are saved and will not show in the next time she/he plays it.

Besides this core model, the first version also has some few additional features. For example, the player could play only with words that the her/him has marked as "important" in all her/his previous sections.

The improvements on the first version that I want to address in this second one are the following:

Improvement | Progress
------------ | -------------
Teach words by showing sentences where that word is used | [ ]
Teach words by grammatical class | [ ]
Present verbs in infinitive form | [ ]
Develop a user-friendly application | [ ]

I hope that others language love programmers join me in this project. I believe that its basic model can easily be expanded to cover other laguages and make the learn of a new language even funnier.
