# A game to learn how to read in German

This is a simple game that I develop to learn how to read in german. It uses free online sources to show the user the meaning of words before he/she actually read the text. The game is interactive and it runs better in Python 3.6. You will need the following libraries installed in your python distribution:

1) pattern
2) random
3) operator
4) pickle
5) gensim
6) colorama

The is a lot of space to develop further this game. In the future I want to develop a mobile-app version of this game.
