# TASKS

The improvements in the first version that I want to address in this second one are the following:

Task | Where | Status
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Include function to delete text after another button is clicked | Third window | -
Teach words by showing sentences where that word is used | to be done | -



I hope that other language love programmers join me in this project. I believe that its basic model can easily be expanded to cover other languages and make the learning of a new language even funnier.
