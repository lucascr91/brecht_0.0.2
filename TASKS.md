# TASKS

The improvements in the first version that I want to address in this second one are the following:

Improvement | Progress | Date
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Teach words by showing sentences where that word is used | [ ] | -
Teach words by grammatical class | [ ] | -
Implement lemmatization | [x] | 12/28/2019
Give the word meaning in German | [x ] | 12/28/2019
Include a feature for image recognition | [ ] | -
Develop a user-friendly application | [ ] | -
Create a dynamic game with buttons | [ ] | -
Learning with meaning but practice with translation | [ ] | -

I hope that other language love programmers join me in this project. I believe that its basic model can easily be expanded to cover other languages and make the learning of a new language even funnier.
